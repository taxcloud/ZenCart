TaxCloud is a free, web-scale sales tax calculation service designed to support all Internet merchants.

This module code allows merchants using Zen Cart to quickly incorporate TaxCloud web services.

Requires PHP 5.0 - relies on the SOAPClient client. 

You will need to create a merchant account at https://taxcloud.net/ to get an apiLoginID and apiKey which is required for each web service call.

For the VerifyAddress service you will need a USPS userID (this is required for this implementation).
